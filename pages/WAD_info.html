<p>While all WADs have been tested on Wii & vWii<br><br> THERE'S STILL A CHANCE YOU CAN BRICK YOUR CONSOLE, Please make sure you have the proper brick protection<br>(ie. Priiloader & BootMii (perferably boot2)) before installing the WADs.</p> 
<p>⚠️ If you paid for any of these WADs, you have been scammed! <br>These forwarders are free for everyone to use, you should request your money back.</p><br>
